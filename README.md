# Stock-Trend-Prediction-Based-on-Technical-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Methods

Team Member: Lyle Chen, Yahua Chen, Ziping Wei, Minghe Zhang 
Our project is based on the thesis paper by Yuan Song, who examined the application of recurrent neural networks (RNN), SVM, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) in predicting price movements of well-known stocks (2018).  

The historical daily adjusted closing price of 20 stocks from Jan.2010 to Nov.2019 was collected from the API of Quandl. We tried LTCM, XGBoost,SVM and Logistic Regression in our project.
